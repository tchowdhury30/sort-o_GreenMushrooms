# Best Case
- BubbleSort: The best case for bubble sort would be no sorting at all, and therefore the elements in the array being listed from least to greatest.

- SelectionSort: The best case for selection sort would also be the elements listed in order from least to greatest, or the least number being placed at the minPos   and the greatest element being placed in the maxPos because then it would be way easier to get the elemts in their proper spaces. However, with the elements         already being in least to greatest form, the elements would not need to be moved at all, and thus it would be the best case possible. 

- InsertionSort: The best case for insertion sort would also be the elements in order from least to greatest because with each partition, the elements would already   be sorted, so with every pass, there would be no swaps necessary. 

# Worst Case
