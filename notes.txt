Lab04 Never Fear, Big O is Here!

DISCO
- Nested for loops increases time complexity expontentially
- A for loop only matters in time complexity if the resource intensive operations in it run
- The n in O(n) can be roughly the same as the number of passes

- q0: How many passes to sort n elements? a0: n - 1 passes
- q1: What do you know after pass p? a1: elements from 0 to index p are sorted
- q2: How will you know when sorted? a2: When passes = n - 1 or when the partition is at the end
- q3: What constitues a pass? a3: We can only move on from a pass when all the elements on the sorted side are in order and the partition changes
- q4: What must you track? a4: Where the partition is
