Lab04 Never Fear, Big O is Here!

DISCO
- Nested for loops increases time complexity expontentially
- A for loop only matters in time complexity if the resource intensive operations in it run
- The n in O(n) can be roughly the same as the number of passes 

QCC

##BUB-QA

## SEL-QA
 * q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
 * a0: n-1 passes
 * q1: What do you know after pass p?
 * a1: After pass p, all values are set in their final positions at all indexes less than and equal to p-1.
 * q2: How do you know if sorted?
 * a2: If the pass number is equal to or less than  the index+1.
 * q3: What does a pass boil down to?
 * a3: When 1 swap happens between the smallest value and the value at the position its looking at.
 ALGO
 Select smallest element, move to end, then select next smallest, move to next-to-end.
 
## INS-QA
- q0: How many passes to sort n elements? a0: n - 1 passes
- q1: What do you know after pass p? a1: elements from 0 to index p are sorted
- q2: How will you know when sorted? a2: When passes = n - 1 or when the partition is at the end
- q3: What constitues a pass? a3: We can only move on from a pass when all the elements on the sorted side are in order and the partition changes
- q4: What must you track? a4: Where the partition is
